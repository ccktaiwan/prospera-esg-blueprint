1. PURPOSE
This document serves as the canonical entry point for the Prospera 
ESG Blueprint (L2). It defines the strategic logic, compliance 
frameworks, and business rules governing the ESG Certification 
Platform.

2. LOGIC SOVEREIGNTY & TIER ALIGNMENT
The ESG Blueprint occupies the Tier 2 (Strategy & Logic) layer:
- UPSTREAM [L1]: Inherits governance mandates from the Prospera OS 
  Constitution (MND-L1-CON-ESG-001).
- DOWNSTREAM [L3]: Dictates the extraction schemas and validation 
  vectors for the Prospera Exam Platform (L3) engines.

3. STRATEGIC SCOPE (VERTICAL 02)
The primary focus of this blueprint is the "Net-Zero Carbon Planning 
Manager" certification vertical, encompassing:
- V-01: ISO 14064-1/2/3 Carbon Accounting Logic.
- V-02: Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Strategic Alignment.

4. BLUEPRINT INVARIANTS
- I-01: All business rules MUST map directly to an international or 
  regional standard (ISO/PAS/iPAS).
- I-02: Logical schemas defined herein are authoritative over L3 
  engine configurations.
